## Problem

❌ It's really hard to find stuff to do in the city if you don't want to spend money.

✅ We want to chill and exist in our beautiful city without consuming all the time. 
--
We want to answer:

- 🚂 Where can my D-ticket take me for a day trip?
- 🚰 What free amenities are around this cool spot? (benches, drinking water, toilets, parks)
- 🎭 What activities can I do with x money in y time?
- 💃 What cool and free events are in my area?
- 📣 What's going on around my area? Dsemos, citizen exchanges, calls for volunteering, etc?

## Implementation

### Frontend
We use Svelte+TS

### Backend
Python with common OSM libraries (OSMPythonTools, OSMnx) and OpenRouteService.
